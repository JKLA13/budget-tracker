# Budget Tracker - Offline/Online/PWA

## Assignment Task

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:

When brought back online:

## User Story

- GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection
  WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
  THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.

## Business Context

## Acceptance Criteria
